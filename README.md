# Houses

A project used in Angular course for beginners offered by Angular channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1w1q3fL4pmj9k1FrJ3Pe91EPub2_h4jF).

This project will work the basics concepts like Router, Forms, Components and more.

I'm also using a newer version of Angular and because of this I'm checking https://angular.dev/tutorials/

## Requirements

- Node.js;
- Angular.js (I used Angular v17);
- Understand HTML, CSS and TypeScript.

## Development server

First you have to install all necessary packages: `npm install` and then follow the step down bellow.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
